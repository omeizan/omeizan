I am a software developer with a strong foundation in object-oriented programming and web development.



I have worked on a variety of projects using these skills, ranging from building web applications to developing desktop software. I am always looking for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and work on interesting projects.

Feel free to take a look at my repositories to see some of my past work. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, don't hesitate to reach out!
